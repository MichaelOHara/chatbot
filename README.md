* Generates original grammatically correct sentences
  * Knowledge of parts of speech
  * Understanding of what makes a valid sentence
    * Syntactically valid sentence
    * Semantically valid sentence
  * Be able to generate stylistically appropriate sentence based on training materialshould I refer to you?
  * Where do you live?, Where is your home?, What city do you reside in?, Where are you?, Where are you from?
  * How are you?, How are you feeling?, How's it going? How are things?, What's up?

###Stage 2 (Ephemeral Stage)
* Can perform basic semantic analysis on user input
  * Identify question versus statement. Hard code vs soft code?
