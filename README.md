Koanbot
=======

The Koanbot project is a sandbox environment for learning about natural language processing, python programming, and the nltk python package.

Users who wish to interact with it on a surface level, may view the running koanbot live, located [here](http://ec2-54-213-221-186.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/). For those who wish to dig deeper, read on!

The koanbot employs a simple sentence analysis system that uses a few of the many tools available from the nltk package. Fist it filters the user input:

#Input Filters

The input filters take user input as a list of wrods and use some algorithm to reduce this list to a *hopefully* shorter list of possible *seed words*. Current filers include: a length filter that removes all words with less than three characters, and a content filter that removes all non-content words, or words that are not tagged as noun, verb, or adjective. Tagging is done using the nltk package, and will be discussed more later. The input filters can be found in the input_filters.py file.

Adding more filters is quite simple. First write a filter in the input_filters.pf file. It should take a list of strings (words) and return a list of strings (words) after this, add the 'add_func_to_dict' decorator with the name of your filter as the argument.

That's it!

Your filter is now tied in with the project and will be selectable on the website.

#The Brain

The Brain randomly chooses a seed from the seed words that make it through the input filters. It then uses this seed to generate a sentence of some kind, currently we are implementing bi and tri gram generation. It then repeats this process to make a large list (currently 200) of possible sentences.

The process for writing your own brain function is the same as that for the input filters. The file you write them in is brains.py. For input they take an instance of the current chatbot, followed by the list of remaining seed words. For output they should give a list of possible sentences.

Don't forget to decorate!

#Output Filters

The Output filter is the final step. The list of sentences generated by the brain enter into the chosen output filters. Each filter attempts to reduce the number of possible sentences based on some criteria. We have implemented output filters that include: length of sentence limit, sentence must contain at least one noun, adjective, and verb, and even some attempts and syntactic correctness filters.

Again, the process for creating and decorating output filters is quite similar. For input they take a list of possible sentences, and a dictionary. We have four dictionaries that can be used, they will be discussed below. The output is a reduced list of sentences.

#Finally

If more than one sentence remains after the output filter, one is chosen at random from the remainder and printed to the website. In the event that no sentences remain, the koanbot will let you know that it doesn't know what to say.

#Extra Info

##NLTK

The Natural Language Tool Kit is an immense python package that we really only brushed the surface of here. We used it to tag our training data with parts of speech, and to analyze the syntax of the output sentences. One large area for imporovment in our project is finding more ways to utilize this valuable resource.

##Training the Koanbot

Training the koanbot involves constructing four dictionaries that the koanbot can access as it processes user input.
####Word to POS Dictionary
This dictionary contains every word in the training text as a key, with a list of all the parts of speech that the word was tagged as throughout the text.
####POS to Word Dictionary
This dictionary is the inverse of the previous one. It contains all the parts of speech that occur in the training text as a key, with a list of all the words that were tagged as that part of speech as a value.
####Bigram Dictionary
This dictionary contains every word as a key, with a list of every word that ever followed the key as a value.
####Trigram Dictionary
This dictionary contains every pair of words as a key, with a list of every word that ever followed the pair of words as a value.
